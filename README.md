# LAMP Benchmark
A series of benchmarks/tests across multiple high-level linear algebra oriented languages/libraries/frameworks (henceforth referred to as just "languages")
that assess the extent to which said languages translate high-level linear algebra expressions to high-performance code.

## Setup
For instructions on how to setup the benchmarks and install all languages used (and linking to Intel MKL), please consult the [Wiki](https://github.com/ChrisPsa/LAMP_benchmark/wiki) page.
